# DESCRIPTION 

This webpage is a digital portfolio for the artist JENEKO. It was created to showcase their artwork in a clear and professional way, while also making it easy for potential clients or fans to contact them. The design is simple and smooth, guiding the user through different sections that highlight the artist’s skills, projects, and ways to connect. The goal of this site is to help JENEKO present themselves as a serious digital artist who is both creative and approachable for commissions and collaborations.

At the very top of the webpage is the "hero section." This is the large banner area that people see as soon as they land on the site. It uses a background image called `hero-bg.png`, which is one of JENEKO’s own artworks. This instantly gives visitors a feel for the artist’s style. To make sure the white text on top of the image is easy to read, a dark transparent gradient is applied using CSS. This gradient slightly darkens the image while still allowing the art to show through, helping the text stand out clearly.

The hero section also includes the artist’s name, a short description of their work, and a "View My Work" button that encourages people to scroll down. Right after this section, there are links to social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Fiverr. This is helpful for visitors who want to explore more of JENEKO’s content or connect on platforms they already use.

Next comes the main body of the site, which is divided into two gallery sections. The first one is titled "Client Commissions." This section displays artwork that JENEKO has created for clients. Each image is accompanied by a short title and description. This part is especially useful for future clients because it shows the artist's experience and ability to meet client needs.

The second gallery section is called "Personal Projects." It highlights artwork that JENEKO has created independently. These pieces are more experimental or personal in nature. Showing personal work helps the artist express their creativity and style freely, and it also shows potential clients the range of their abilities.

To make the gallery more interactive and visually appealing, a hover effect is used. When someone hovers over an image, the grayscale filter is removed and the artwork appears in full color. This is done using CSS and creates a fun and engaging experience for the viewer. It encourages people to explore more of the gallery.

Finally, the site ends with a contact section titled "Let’s Connect." This section offers several ways to get in touch with JENEKO, including email and social media links. This part of the website is simple but very important, as it helps turn viewers into potential clients.

Overall, the website was built using React, a popular JavaScript library. React helps organize the site into reusable pieces called components, which makes it easier to manage and update. The layout is responsive, meaning it adjusts to fit different screen sizes like phones and tablets. CSS is used to style the entire site, creating a modern, clean, and professional look.

In short, this website is a strong and effective portfolio that not only displays JENEKO’s artistic talent but also makes it easy for people to explore their work and get in touch.
